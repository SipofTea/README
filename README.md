## Else Meijerink (she/her)
### Full Stack Junior Software Developer

I am a scientist turned Software Developer. I started off in Biomedical Science, Bio-archaeology, and Forensic Anthropology but became a code enthusiast whilst working in Localisation Quality Assurance. After writing some of my own projects I took the plunge and started Maker's Academy Full-Stack Developer Bootcamp. I recently graduated and am looking for a role that will help me combine my creativity with my desire to grow. I have experience in JavaScript and Ruby, and Iâ€™m also familiar with statically typed languages.

I like creating lasting solutions; while doing LQA I noticed that for some projects the text was automatically translated by copying a previous translation. When translations are specific like jokes, this can lead to very odd outcomes. Rather than only changing the new string, I made sure all occurrences were changed to something suitable so it wouldn't happen again. Whilst mentoring junior colleagues I noticed many questions were asked by every tester, multiple times. Thatâ€™s why I took the initiative to write a guide with answers to common questions relating to Dutch testing. I bring this same proactive attention to detail to my coding, with responsive designs and DRY principles.

**Testronic Laboratories** (October 2019 to May 2021)  
_Localisation Quality Assurance Tester_

- Attention to detail: I learned to look at applications in a very detailed way, checking for well localised translation, phrasing, layout and functional issues, logging bugs on JIRA and providing appropriate suggestions and translations.
- Conflict management: working in a large, multicultural team helped me develop my communication and collaboration skills as I coordinated work with other team members and other teams.
- Mentoring junior colleagues: After their initial onboarding I mentored junior colleagues, helping them get up to speed with our systems and ways of working. I learned to multitask efficiently: progressing with my own tasks whilst assisting and answering questions in a remote environment.

_Site Assistant at HS2 Euston Excavation_
- Excavating human remains and grave furnishings at the burial ground in St. James' Gardens: I excavated complicated, three dimensional contexts and recorded my findings digitally. 
- Processing human remains post-excavation: I worked under tight deadlines to clean excavated remains to a high standard.
